# Arvato Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population.

## Libraries Used
- NumPy, Pandas
- Sklearn (PCA, KMeans, StandardScaler, GradientBoosting)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Summary of Results
- **Clustering:** We identified 10 distinct customer segments. Clusters 1, 4, and 5 were significantly over-represented in the customer base.
- **Prediction:** The final Gradient Boosting model achieved a ROC-AUC score of 0.9105.
